# Diagnosing Malaria Using Convolutional Neural Networks


In this MeetUp event, we will be following the following tutorial from the PyImageSearch blog:
https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/12/03/deep-learning-and-medical-image-analysis-with-keras/

###Steps to follow:
1) Clone the repository
2) Go to the malaria folder and execute the bash file with ```bash get_dataset.sh```
3) Set up the virtual environment by executing ```bash setup_environment.sh```
If you haven't yet set up an EC2 instance with access to a GPU, please following the MeetUp activity from the 1st of October ![here](https://github.com/jjpd777/meetup-applied-deep-learning/tree/master/oct-01-2019/transfer-learning-keras)
